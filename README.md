# Zira â€“ A Mini Project Management System

Zira is a lightweight project management application inspired by Jira. It allows teams to create projects, assign members, manage to-do lists, and visualize project progress using pie charts.

  - Create new projects  
  - Add members to projects  
  - Assign tasks to team members  

- **Task Tracking**:  
  - Personal to-do lists for each user based on assigned tasks  
  - Task statuses: To Do, In Progress, Done  

- **Progress Visualization**:  
  - Pie charts representing task status for each project  

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:  
  - Struts (MVC framework)

  - HTML5, CSS3  
  - JavaScript (for dynamic behaviors)
